Omar Mohamed Salah — Portfolio (Dark Theme)
==========================================

This is a ready-to-deploy static portfolio website built with plain HTML, CSS, and a tiny contact form integration.

How to deploy (GitHub Pages):
1. Create a new repository on GitHub named: <your-username>.github.io
2. Upload the files and folders from this project root to that repository.
3. Commit and push. GitHub Pages will serve the site at: https://<your-username>.github.io

Alternative: Deploy to Netlify
1. Create a new site and drag & drop the project folder.
2. Netlify will provide a public URL.

Customization:
- Replace the Formspree endpoint in contact.html with your own (or set up Netlify forms).
- Add real screenshots to assets/images/ and update project cards accordingly.

Omar Mohamed Salah — One-page Tailwind Portfolio
=================================================

This is a single-page (dark theme) portfolio built with Tailwind CSS CDN for quick deployment on GitHub Pages.

How to deploy:
1. Create repository named 'omarrsalah.github.io' (if not already created).
2. Upload the files in this folder to the repository root.
3. Commit and push. GitHub Pages will serve the site at https://omarrsalah.github.io

Notes:
- The contact form uses Formspree as an example. Replace the action URL with your own form endpoint if desired.
- Replace 'resume.pdf' with your actual resume file (upload it to the repo root).
- Edit the projects and content directly in index.html to add screenshots or repo links.
